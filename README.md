# clojure-machine-learning

My notes for Clojure for Machine Learning. These are my notes and really just a reference for me - feel free to have a look, but I can't promise I'll do any justice to Akhil Wali's book

Before you run this code, I strongly suggest you first read Clojure for the Brave and True (http://www.braveclojure.com/)
